      FrenchShaala is a French language learning platform that started its journey in 2018 with offline classroom teaching.
      Over the years, it has grown into a pan-India French learning community, helping students from different cities learn French
      in a structured, engaging, and practical way.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:14px;">
      Our goal is to make quality French education accessible across India and continue expanding our reach to learners who are passionate about the language.

      <strong>Our Vision & Social Impact:</strong><br />
      At FrenchShaala, we believe education has the power to create change. Along with teaching French, we aim to give back to society by facilitating education
      for children in need and orphans, ensuring that learning reaches those who need it the most.

      I’m Riddhi Shah, the founder of FrenchShaala, and French has always been more than just a language for me—it’s a passion I love sharing.
      Over the years, I have taught 150+ learners from diverse age groups, ranging from 8 to 50 years, guiding them through their French learning journey
      with clarity and confidence.

      I am a Certified DU FLE Trainer and DELF B2 Certified, combining strong academic training with hands-on teaching experience.
      My focus is on building a strong foundation, real-life language usage, and making French enjoyable and approachable for every learner.
